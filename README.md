## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to align text on same line by wrapping them in a container so they look left-aligned without much stress and also aligning text and imgs using the vertical-align property

```css
.user-info img {
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to get better at using the `position: relative` and other position properties and also understanding containers and using them right.
